For those familiar with Git:

    git clone git@github.com:cbeams/spring-3.1-profiles-java.git

Or if you prefer using Subversion:

    svn co http://svn.github.com/cbeams/spring-3.1-profiles-java.git spring-3.1-profiles-java.git

Once checked out, you can build from the command line using either Gradle or
Maven.  If you're new to Gradle, don't worry -- there's nothing for you to
install.  Simply use the 'gradlew' (or 'gradlew.bat' on windows) script within
the root directory of the project:

    >$ ./gradlew build

And the following will give you a list of all available tasks:

    >$ ./gradlew tasks

If necessary, this 'Gradle wrapper' script will download a distribution of
Gradle for you.

Generate project metadata appropriate to your IDE with

    >$ ./gradlew eclipse
        - or -
    >$ ./gradlew idea


If you prefer Maven, you can simply type:

    >$ mvn test

If you're using an IDE that supports Maven-based projects, you can import the
project directly from its POM.  Otherwise, generate IDE metadata with

    >$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
        - or -
    >$ mvn idea:idea
